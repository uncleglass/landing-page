# Landing Page
## Udacity Front End Developer nanodegree project

This is a very simple multi-section landing page. HTML and CSS code was provided by Udacity. JS code was written by me. JS code is responsible for building navigation bar, smooth scrolling and distinguishing 'active' section. 'Active' means it takes up the most space of the screan.
